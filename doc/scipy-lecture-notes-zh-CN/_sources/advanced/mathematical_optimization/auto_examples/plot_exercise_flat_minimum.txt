Finding a minimum in a flat neighborhood
=========================================

An excercise of finding minimum. This excercise is hard because the
function is very flat around the minimum (all its derivatives are zero).
Thus gradient information is unreliable.

The function admits a minimum in [0, 0]. The challenge is to get within
1e-7 of this minimum, starting at x0 = [1, 1].

The solution that we adopt here is to give up on using gradient or
information based on local differences, and to rely on the Powell
algorithm. With 162 function evaluations, we get to 1e-8 of the
solution.
